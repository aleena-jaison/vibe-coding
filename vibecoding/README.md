# 🐼 Mochi – Your Emotional Companion on Desktop

**Mochi** is a lightweight, frameless Electron application built with React and TypeScript.  
It introduces **Mochi the Panda** — an emotionally intelligent floating companion who sits with you while you use your computer, helping you feel seen, supported, and softly nudged when motivation dips.

This is not a productivity tracker. It’s a presence — built to reflect your mood, respond to your energy, and gently help you reconnect with your intent.

## 💡 What It Does

Mochi the Panda floats in a small, transparent, always-on-top window. It interacts with you through emotion-based animations and minimalist UI prompts.

### 🌱 Key Features

| Situation | Mochi's Reaction |
|-----------|------------------|
| 🧑‍💻 You open your laptop | Greets you with a wave and smile |
| 😴 You go idle | Gets sleepy or sad, gently checks in |
| ✨ You start typing | Mochi mimics working beside you |
| 💬 You click it | Mood check pops up: "Happy", "Meh", or "Off" |
| 🎲 Click “Play” | Shows a cute quote, joke, or calming message |
| 🐌 You’re inactive for a long time | Mochi stays — quiet and present, not judging |

Mochi supports you emotionally — even when you're not "productive."

### Why This Exists
We all have days where opening the laptop feels hard.
Mochi was built for those days — to help you stay connected, emotionally present, and okay with trying, failing, and showing up again.

If no one else ever uses this but it helps the creator — it has succeeded.
